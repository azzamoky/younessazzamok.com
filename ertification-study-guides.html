            <h3>1. Organization Setup</h3>
            <p>Organization setup is the foundational aspect of Salesforce administration. This module covers the basic settings that define how your Salesforce organization operates. Key areas include company settings, fiscal year settings, currency management, and user interface settings. Understanding these configurations is crucial as they impact the entire organization.</p>
            <p>Company settings involve defining your company's name, address, default language, and time zone. Fiscal year settings determine how your company tracks its financial data, which can be standard (following the Gregorian calendar) or custom. Currency management allows you to handle multiple currencies within Salesforce, essential for organizations operating in different countries.</p>
            <p>User interface settings enable you to customize the appearance and functionality of Salesforce to meet the needs of your users. This includes configuring themes, layouts, and navigation settings to enhance user experience. Familiarize yourself with these settings by practicing on Trailhead and using the setup menu in Salesforce.</p>
            <ul>

            </ul>

            <h3>2. User Setup</h3>
            <p>Setting up users is a fundamental task for Salesforce administrators. This module covers creating and managing user accounts, assigning roles and profiles, and setting up login policies. Proper user setup ensures that users have the appropriate access to Salesforce functionalities while maintaining security and compliance.</p>
            <p>User accounts are created to provide individuals access to Salesforce. When setting up a user, you need to specify their username, email, role, and profile. Roles determine the user's position in the organization's hierarchy, affecting data visibility through role hierarchy settings. Profiles define the user's permissions, including which objects and fields they can access and modify.</p>
            <p>Login policies include password policies, IP restrictions, and session settings. These policies help secure your Salesforce organization by enforcing strong passwords, limiting login access to specific IP ranges, and controlling session timeout durations. Practicing user setup on Trailhead will help you understand these concepts and apply them effectively.</p>

            </ul>

            <h3>3. Security and Access</h3>
            <p>Security and access are critical components of Salesforce administration. This module covers the different layers of security, including organization-wide defaults, role hierarchies, sharing rules, and permission sets. Understanding these security controls ensures that users have appropriate access to data while protecting sensitive information.</p>
            <p>Organization-wide defaults (OWDs) set the baseline level of access for records in Salesforce. Role hierarchies enable managers to access their subordinates' data based on their position in the hierarchy. Sharing rules allow you to grant additional record access based on criteria such as record ownership or field values.</p>
            <p>Permission sets provide additional permissions to users without changing their profiles. They are useful for granting temporary or specific access to users as needed. Practicing these security settings on Trailhead will help you implement effective security measures in your Salesforce organization.</p>

            </ul>

            <h3>4. Standard and Custom Objects</h3>
            <p>Objects are the building blocks of Salesforce. This module covers both standard objects (predefined by Salesforce) and custom objects (created to meet specific business needs). Understanding how to manage these objects, including fields, relationships, and record types, is essential for effective Salesforce administration.</p>
            <p>Standard objects, such as Accounts, Contacts, and Opportunities, come with predefined fields and relationships. Custom objects are created to store information specific to your organization. When creating custom objects, you can define custom fields, set up field dependencies, and establish relationships with other objects (e.g., lookup and master-detail relationships).</p>
            <p>Record types allow you to offer different business processes, picklist values, and page layouts to different users based on their profiles. This is useful for organizations that need to manage various processes within a single object. Practicing object management on Trailhead will help you understand these concepts and apply them effectively.</p>
